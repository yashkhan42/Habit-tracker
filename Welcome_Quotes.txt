Habits are the architects of our destiny. Design them wisely.
Your habits determine your character; choose them with care.
Strive for progress, not perfection in your habits.
Your habits shape your identity. Who do you want to become?
Don't chase the urgent; prioritize the important through habit.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Your habits should align with your goals; otherwise, you're just spinning your wheels.
Focus on systems, not just goals. Great habits are the systems that lead to great results.
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
Be the architect of your life, not a bystander.
Motivation may get you started, but habits will keep you going.
It's not about finding time; it's about making time for what matters most.
Your habits are your legacy; what do you want to leave behind?
The only way to predict your future is to create it through your daily habits.
Greatness is not a destination; it's a continual journey of self-improvement.
You are the captain of your habits; steer them in the direction of your dreams.
